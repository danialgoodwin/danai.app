# DAN AI

A few ideas for my AI. Not necessarily machine learning.


- AI is a programming language that understands itself
    - 'What is var x'
    - 'Given x, what is y'
- AI doesn't need to start by knowing English
    - It's okay that AI doesn't really understand what 'things' are. What *really* is a 'chair' or 'water bottle'? What's important is that it can recognize a 'thing' if seen or described.
- It would be great for the AI to understand 'numbers', but it doesn't need to understand 'letters', at first.

Ideas for learning:
- Go through kindergarten (or pre-K) learning materials
- Possibly use animal training techniques

Open questions:
- How to teach 'numbers'?


definitions: {
  'water bottle': 'a bottle to drink water from'
}
